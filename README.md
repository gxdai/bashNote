# bashNote

## difference between > and >>
* The ">" sign is used for redirecting the output of a program to something other than stdout (standard output, which is the terminal by default).

* The >> appends to a file or creates the file if it doesn't exist.

## Difference between $() and ${}

* `$(command)` is the same as `` `command` `` (!!!!)
