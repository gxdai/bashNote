# Note for regular expression in grep
GNU/Linux operating system has three different types of regular expressions:
* Basic regular expression (BRE)
* Extended regular expression (ERE)
* Perl regular expression (PRE)

**grep: global regular expression print**

## Basic Regular Expression vs. Extened Regular Expression.
The main difference is that
* In basic regular expression, the meta-characters: **`?, +, {, |, (, and )`** lose their special meanings. To give meta-characters its special meaning they need to be **escaped with backslash character**<span style="color:blue">**escaped with backslash character**</span>.

## Backet Expression "[" and "]"
## `()` could be used to override the precedence.
## sed
If  no ` -e,  --expression,  -f, or --file` option is given, then the first non-option argument is taken as the sed script to interpret.  All remaining arguments are names of input files; if no
input files are specified, then the standard input is read.
