# Introduction of string
There are two types of strings in python:
* Traditional `str`
* New `unicode`, `str`.

**`r` doesn't change the type at all, it just changes how the string literal is interpreted.**

Without the `r`, the backslashes are treated as escape characters. With `r`, backslashes are treated as literla. Either way, the type is the same.
